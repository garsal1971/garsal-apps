# CLAUDE.md — garsal-apps

This file provides context for AI assistants working in this repository.

---

## Project Overview

**garsal-apps** is a collection of personal productivity web applications deployed to Netlify. Each app is a **single self-contained HTML file** with no build step, no package manager, and no external source files. All styling and JavaScript live inline within the HTML.

The suite is branded **AppSphere** and the UI language is **Italian**.

## Repository Structure

```
garsal-apps/
├── app-launcher.html    # AppSphere — main entry point / app launcher
├── tasks.html           # Tasks v19.17.12 — task management
├── habit-tracker.html   # Habit Stack Tracker — habit tracking with gamification
├── events-log.html      # Events Log v2.0 — event/activity logging
├── weight-quest.html    # Weight Quest v2.4.1 — weight tracking with charts
└── netlify.toml         # Netlify deployment config (root → app-launcher.html)
```

There is **no** `package.json`, `node_modules`, `build/`, or `dist/` directory. Every app ships as-is.

## Technology Stack

| Concern | Solution |
|---|---|
| Language | Vanilla HTML + CSS + JavaScript (ES2020+) |
| Backend / Auth | [Supabase](https://supabase.com) (PostgreSQL BaaS) |
| Deployment | Netlify (static hosting, no functions) |
| Charts | Chart.js v4.4.0 + chartjs-plugin-zoom (weight-quest only) |
| Touch gestures | Hammer.js (weight-quest only) |
| Fonts | Google Fonts — DM Sans / DM Mono (launcher), Space Mono / Darker Grotesque (other apps) |
| Supabase JS SDK | `@supabase/supabase-js@2` via jsDelivr CDN (most apps); weight-quest uses a custom minimal inline client |

---

## Architecture Patterns

### Single-file HTML apps
Each `.html` file is fully standalone: HTML structure, `<style>` CSS, and `<script>` JavaScript all in one file. There are no imports, no modules (except for the CDN scripts), and no transpilation.

### Supabase backend
All apps share **one Supabase project**:

```js
const SUPABASE_URL = 'https://jajlmmdsjlvzgcxiiypk.supabase.co';
const SUPABASE_KEY = '<anon public key>'; // safe to be public; RLS controls access
```

Apps use the Supabase JavaScript client initialised from the CDN:
```js
const sb = window.supabase.createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY);
```

**weight-quest.html** is the exception — it ships its own minimal inline `SupabaseClient` class (no CDN dependency) and queries Google Fit directly via OAuth.

### Authentication flow
1. `app-launcher.html` handles Google OAuth via Supabase Auth
2. On successful login, tokens are stored in `sessionStorage`:
   - `sb_token` — Supabase JWT access token
   - `google_token` — raw Google OAuth provider token (for Google Fit API)
3. When the launcher opens a child app (`window.open`), it passes the Google token via `postMessage`:
   ```js
   win.postMessage({ type: 'GOOGLE_TOKEN', token: googleToken }, '*');
   ```
4. Child apps listen for `GOOGLE_TOKEN` messages and store the token in `localStorage` for persistence.

### Navigation pattern (Tasks, Habit Tracker, Events Log)
Apps use a **sidebar nav** with `data-section` buttons toggling `.page` sections:
```
sidebar nav-item (click) → showPage(sectionName) → hide all sections, show target
```
Layout: `grid-template-columns: 280px 1fr` — sidebar left, main content right. Responsive mobile menu via a hamburger toggle.

## Database Schema

Tables are namespaced by app prefix:

### Shared (`cm_`)
| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `cm_apps` | App registry for the launcher (title, description, html_file, score_query, active) |
| `cm_categories` | Shared category taxonomy used by Tasks and Habit Tracker |

### Tasks (`ts_`)
| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ts_tasks` | All tasks |
| `ts_history` | Audit log of task state changes |
| `ts_priorities` | Configurable priority levels |
| `ts_settings` | Key-value app settings |
| `ts_notes` | Free-form notes / appunti |

**Task types** in `ts_tasks.type`:
- `single` — one-off task with a `start_date`
- `recurring` — repeats on a schedule with `next_occurrence_date`
- `simple_recurring` — simpler recurrence variant
- `multiple` — task with multiple scheduled dates
- `free_repeat` — repeatable without a fixed schedule
- `workflow` — multi-step workflow task

### Habit Tracker (`hb_`)
| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `hb_habits` | Habit definitions |
| `hb_completions` | Daily completion records |
| `hb_user_points` | Gamification points balance |
| `hb_points_transactions` | Points ledger |
| `hb_archived_stacks` | Archived habit stacks |

### Events Log (`el_`)
| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `el_groups` | Event category groups |
| `el_events` | Event definitions |
| `el_logs` | Event log entries |

### Weight Quest (`ps_`)
| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ps_weight_tracking` | Weight measurement entries |

## App Details

### `app-launcher.html` — AppSphere
- Draggable **bubble/circle UI** — each app is a coloured circle sized proportionally to its `score`
- Score is computed at load time by calling the Supabase RPC `run_score_query` with the SQL stored in `cm_apps.score_query`
- Circle placement uses an iterative collision-resolution algorithm (no overlap, viewport-clamped)
- Tap = launch app; drag = reposition circle
- Color palette: Olympic rings colors (`#0081C8`, `#FCB131`, `#1A1A1A`, `#00A651`, `#EE334E`)

### `tasks.html` — Tasks
- Full task lifecycle: create, edit, complete, clone, delete
- Calendar/planner view with recurring task support
- European date format display (`dd/mm/yyyy`) with ISO storage
- Sidebar sections: Dashboard, Categories, Planner, Reminders, Notes, Priority settings, Settings
- Significant file (~8 900 lines); sections delineated by `// ========================================` comments

### `habit-tracker.html` — Habit Stack Tracker
- Stack-based habits with daily completion tracking
- Gamification: points, multipliers, streaks
- Imports/exports via JSON backup

### `events-log.html` — Events Log
- Groups → Events → Logs hierarchy
- Quick-log UI: select event, tap to log with timestamp

### `weight-quest.html` — Weight Quest
- Chart.js weight graph centred on today (30-day window, scrollable)
- Google Fit integration via OAuth token
- Minimal inline Supabase client (no CDN); milestone and objective tracking

## Development Workflow

### No build step
Edit the HTML file directly. Refresh the browser. Done.

```bash
# Open a file locally — no server required for most features
open tasks.html

# Or use a local HTTP server for auth redirect flows
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

### Deployment
Netlify auto-deploys on push to `master`. Configuration in `netlify.toml`:
```toml
[build]
  publish = "."
  base = "."

[[redirects]]
  from = "/"
  to = "/app-launcher.html"
  status = 200
```

Push to `master` → Netlify picks it up → live within seconds.

### Git workflow
- `master` — production branch (auto-deployed to Netlify)
- Feature branches follow `claude/<description>-<id>` convention (e.g. `claude/add-claude-documentation-3yPWQ`)
- Commit message prefixes used in this repo:
  - `feat:` — new feature
  - `fix:` — bug fix
  - `ui:` — visual / layout change
  - `refactor:` — code restructure without behaviour change
  - `chore:` — tooling, config, or non-functional change

## Key Conventions

### CSS variables (Tasks, Habit Tracker, Events Log)
All three share an identical CSS custom property palette:
```css
:root {
  --primary: #FF3366;
  --secondary: #6C5CE7;
  --success: #00B894;
  --warning: #F39C12;
  --danger: #E74C3C;
  --dark: #1F2937;
  --light: #FFFFFF;
  --muted: #6B7280;
  --accent: #2563EB;
  --border: #E5E7EB;
  --card-bg: #FFFFFF;
  --input-bg: #F9FAFB;
}
```

### Date handling
- Dates are stored as ISO strings (`YYYY-MM-DD`) in Supabase
- Displayed in European format (`dd/mm/yyyy`) in the UI
- **Critical**: avoid UTC conversion when extracting local dates — use `new Date(str)` carefully or split the ISO string directly to prevent off-by-one day bugs

### Supabase error handling pattern
```js
const { data, error } = await sb.from('table').select('*');
if (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    alert('Errore: ' + (error.message || 'Unknown error'));
} else {
    // use data
}
```

### Version in title
App versions are tracked in the `<title>` tag and displayed in the sidebar (e.g. `Tasks v19.17.12`). Increment the patch version on meaningful changes.

### No TypeScript / no linting
There is no TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, or any linting/formatting tool configured. Code style follows existing patterns in each file.

### Italian language
All user-facing strings, comments, and variable names (where contextual) are in Italian. Commit messages are also often in Italian. Match the existing language when adding code.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **CDN dependency**: Apps require internet access to load Supabase JS, Chart.js, Google Fonts, etc. They will not work fully offline.
2. **Auth token scope**: The Supabase anon key is public but Row Level Security (RLS) on Supabase controls access. Do not assume tables are publicly writable — the user must be authenticated.
3. **weight-quest auth**: Unlike other apps, weight-quest does NOT use the Supabase JS SDK for auth; it uses raw Google OAuth + its own minimal client. Token is received via `postMessage` from the launcher or retrieved from `localStorage`.
4. **Large file sizes**: `tasks.html` is ~445 KB and ~8 900 lines. When editing, use search to navigate to the relevant section. Sections are marked with `// ========================================` banners.
5. **No hot reload**: There is no dev server. After editing, hard-refresh the browser (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+R`).
6. **Duplicate `renderTaskCard`**: `tasks.html` defines `renderTaskCard` in two places (dashboard view and categories/management view). Both must be kept in sync when changing card rendering logic.
